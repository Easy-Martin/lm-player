The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {Function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\n\nvar Promise = function () {\n  function Promise(resolver) {\n    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function(user){\n    // user is available\n  }, function(reason){\n    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n  });\n  ```\n   Chaining\n  --------\n   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return user.name;\n  }, function (reason) {\n    return 'default name';\n  }).then(function (userName) {\n    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n    // will be `'default name'`\n  });\n   findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n  }, function (reason) {\n    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n  });\n  ```\n  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n  });\n  ```\n   Assimilation\n  ------------\n   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // The user's comments are now available\n  });\n  ```\n   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n  });\n  ```\n   Simple Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let result;\n   try {\n    result = findResult();\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n  findResult(function(result, err){\n    if (err) {\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findResult().then(function(result){\n    // success\n  }, function(reason){\n    // failure\n  });\n  ```\n   Advanced Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let author, books;\n   try {\n    author = findAuthor();\n    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n   function foundBooks(books) {\n   }\n   function failure(reason) {\n   }\n   findAuthor(function(author, err){\n    if (err) {\n      failure(err);\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      try {\n        findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n          if (err) {\n            failure(err);\n          } else {\n            try {\n              foundBooks(books);\n            } catch(reason) {\n              failure(reason);\n            }\n          }\n        });\n      } catch(error) {\n        failure(err);\n      }\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findAuthor().\n    then(findBooksByAuthor).\n    then(function(books){\n      // found books\n  }).catch(function(reason){\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n  ```\n   @method then\n  @param {Function} onFulfilled\n  @param {Function} onRejected\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise}\n  */\n\n  /**\n  `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n  as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n  ```js\n  function findAuthor(){\n  throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n  }\n  // synchronous\n  try {\n  findAuthor();\n  } catch(reason) {\n  // something went wrong\n  }\n  // async with promises\n  findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n  // something went wrong\n  });\n  ```\n  @method catch\n  @param {Function} onRejection\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise}\n  */\n\n\n  Promise.prototype.catch = function _catch(onRejection) {\n    return this.then(null, onRejection);\n  };\n\n  /**\n    `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate just as native\n    try/catch/finally behaves\n  \n    Synchronous example:\n  \n    ```js\n    findAuthor() {\n      if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\n        throw new Error();\n      }\n      return new Author();\n    }\n  \n    try {\n      return findAuthor();

On re-entrant calls, sub-sequent calls are scheduled for next main loop ticks.\n *\n * When the task execution (`tick` method) is called in re-entrant way this is detected and\n * we are limiting the task execution per call stack to exactly one, but scheduling/post-poning further\n * task processing on the next main loop iteration (also known as \"next tick\" in the Node/JS runtime lingo).\n */\n\nexport default class TaskLoop extends EventHandler {\n  constructor (hls, ...events) {\n    super(hls, ...events);\n\n    this._tickInterval = null;\n    this._tickTimer = null;\n    this._tickCallCount = 0;\n    this._boundTick = this.tick.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @override\n   */\n  onHandlerDestroying () {\n    // clear all timers before unregistering from event bus\n    this.clearNextTick();\n    this.clearInterval();\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @returns {boolean}\n   */\n  hasInterval () {\n    return !!this._tickInterval;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @returns {boolean}\n   */\n  hasNextTick () {\n    return !!this._tickTimer;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @param {number} millis Interval time (ms)\n   * @returns {boolean} True when interval has been scheduled, false when already scheduled (no effect)\n   */\n  setInterval (millis) {\n    if (!this._tickInterval) {\n      this._tickInterval = setInterval(this._boundTick, millis);\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @returns {boolean} True when interval was cleared, false when none was set (no effect)\n   */\n  clearInterval () {\n    if (this._tickInterval) {\n      clearInterval(this._tickInterval);\n      this._tickInterval = null;\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @returns {boolean} True when timeout was cleared, false when none was set (no effect)\n   */\n  clearNextTick () {\n    if (this._tickTimer) {\n      clearTimeout(this._tickTimer);\n      this._tickTimer = null;\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Will call the subclass doTick implementation in this main loop tick\n   * or in the next one (via setTimeout(,0)) in case it has already been called\n   * in this tick (in case this is a re-entrant call).\n   */\n  tick () {\n    this._tickCallCount++;\n    if (this._tickCallCount === 1) {\n      this.doTick();\n      // re-entrant call to tick from previous doTick call stack\n      // -> schedule a call on the next main loop iteration to process this task processing request\n      if (this._tickCallCount > 1) {\n        // make sure only one timer exists at any time at max\n        this.clearNextTick();\n        this._tickTimer = setTimeout(this._boundTick, 0);\n      }\n      this._tickCallCount = 0;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * For subclass to implement task logic\n   * @abstract\n   */\n  doTick () {}\n}\n","const DECIMAL_RESOLUTION_REGEX = /^(\\d+)x(\\d+)$/; // eslint-disable-line no-useless-escape\nconst ATTR_LIST_REGEX = /\\s*(.+?)\\s*=((?:\\\".*?\\\")|.*?)(?:,|$)/g; // eslint-disable-line no-useless-escape\n\n// adapted from https://github.com/kanongil/node-m3u8parse/blob/master/attrlist.js\nclass AttrList {\n  constructor (attrs) {\n    if (typeof attrs === 'string') {\n      attrs = AttrList.parseAttrList(attrs);\n    }\n\n    for (let attr in attrs) {\n      if (attrs.hasOwnProperty(attr)) {\n        this[attr] = attrs[attr];\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  decimalInteger (attrName) {\n    const intValue = parseInt(this[attrName], 10);\n    if (intValue > Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) {\n      return Infinity;\n    }\n\n    return intValue;\n  }\n\n  hexadecimalInteger (attrName) {\n    if (this[attrName]) {\n      let stringValue = (this[attrName] || '0x').slice(2);\n      stringValue = ((stringValue.length & 1) ?
